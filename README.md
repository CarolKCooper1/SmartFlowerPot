# SmartFlowerPot
This smart flower pot automatically senses when your plants soil is too dry and waters it for you. It also monitors the enviromental factors like room temperature, humidity, barometric pressure, air quality and dust. It is easily monitored on an online dashboard. There is a convienient button on the dashboard which allows for easy supplemental watering from anywhere with an internet connection. This project was created in an IoT bootcamp class through CNM.
